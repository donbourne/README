# Using Actions in kAppNav

Kubernetes Application Navigator (kAppNav) provides a set of default, context-based actions for Kubernetes resources as well as some runtimes within the managed containers.

Out of the box, kAppNav provides context-based linking into the Kubernetes management console (Vanilla Kubernetes or OpenShift Cluster Console), as well as links into dashbaords provided by Prometheus and Grafana (if those tools are installed).
